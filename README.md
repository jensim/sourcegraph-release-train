This repo just creates a build pipeline on top of [sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph)-OSS.
The [enterprise version](https://hub.docker.com/r/sourcegraph/server) is great, but I cannot afford it beyond the trial, and since I like automating things,
I thought I'd automate the release pipeline for the OSS docker image.
